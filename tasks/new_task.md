# Building a Simple Game Application

This week, you will embark on creating a simple game application. Throughout this task, you'll learn to manage player movements, implement a scoring system, and handle enemy interactions in Java. This project will help you grasp Java collections - `Arrays` and `ArrayLists` - for organizing objects in the game environment.

### üìù Preparation

- Review the [lecture slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qIjQ10Dy7RW00wit0Ud5vX_012pH_1chOcuvpkt03cg/edit#slide=id.p)
- Read and answer all questions in [Module 5: Grouping Objects](https://qbl.sys.kth.se/sections/dd1337_programming/container/grouping_objects)

### ‚úÖ Learning Goals

This week's learning goals include:

* Working with `Arrays`
* Understanding the `static` keyword
* Working with `ArrayLists`
* Combining loops and collections

### üö® Troubleshooting Guide

If you encounter any issues, follow these steps:

1. Check this week's [posted issues](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/inda-24/help/issues) to see if other students are discussing your problem.
2. If not, create a [New Issue](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/inda-24/help/issues/new). Give a concise descriptive title that begins with "Task *x*: *summary of problem here*".
3. Seek assistance from a TA during the [weekly lab](https://queue.csc.kth.se/Queue/INDA). Check your schedule for the next lab session.

Collaborate with peers to enhance understanding, **but do not share answers!** Similarly, AI services ü§ñ can help explain concepts, **but refrain from submitting AI-generated solutions.** Ensure you understand and can explain your own solutions.

### üèõ Assignment

This assignment involves creating a simple 2D game application in Java, centering around managing a player character, scoring points, and interacting with enemies. You will utilize both `Arrays` and `ArrayLists` to store and manipulate game elements efficiently.

#### Arrays in Java

Arrays in Java are static in size and can store a specific number of elements of a single type. When working with arrays, remember that Java arrays are zero-indexed.

```java
int[] scores = new int[10]; // Array to store 10 scores
scores[0] = 100;            // Set the first score
```

```java
// Looping through arrays
for (int i = 0; i < scores.length; i++) {
    System.out.println("Score: " + scores[i]);
}
```

Arrays are a powerful but fixed-size structure for storing sequence data.

#### ArrayLists in Java

ArrayLists in Java are dynamic arrays and allow elements to be added and removed as needed. They can grow as required.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

ArrayList<String> playerActions = new ArrayList<>();
playerActions.add("Run");
playerActions.add("Jump");

// There can be duplicates
for (String action : playerActions) {
    System.out.println("Player Action: " + action);
}
```

The advantage of `ArrayList` is their dynamic resizing, which makes them highly suitable for scenarios where the number of elements is not known upfront.

#### Static Keyword

The `static` keyword in Java signifies that a particular field or method is associated with the class rather than any individual object. It allows you to define methods or variables that are shared across all instances of a class.

```java
public class GameUtils {
    public static int calculateScore(int level, int baseScore) {
        return baseScore * level;
    }
}

// Usage without creating an instance
int newScore = GameUtils.calculateScore(3, 100);
```

### üéØ Task Overview

Your task is to create a minimal 2D game application, implementing core functionalities such as player movement, interaction with enemies, and score tracking.

#### File Structure

Create a folder `src` to store your Java files and work from there. The main components of your game application should be structured as follows:
- `Game.java`
- `Player.java`
- `Enemy.java`
- `GameUtils.java`

#### Exercise 6.0 -- Setting Up the Game

Begin by creating a `Game` class in a file called `Game.java`. This class will have an `ArrayList` managing the enemies on the screen and an `Array` for the player's score tracking.

```java
public class Game {
    private Player player;
    private ArrayList<Enemy> enemies;
    private static int[] scores; // Array to track scores per level

    public Game() {
        this.player = new Player();
        this.enemies = new ArrayList<>();
        scores = new int[10]; // Assume 10 levels
    }

    public static void setScore(int level, int score) {
        scores[level] = score;
    }
}
```

#### Exercise 6.1 -- Player Movement

Develop a `Player` class in `Player.java` that manages player positions within an array representing a 2D grid.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Player {
    private int x, y;
    
    public Player() {
        this.x = 0;
        this.y = 0; // Start position
    }

    public void move(char direction) {
        switch (direction) {
            case 'W': y--; break; // Move up
            case 'S': y++; break; // Move down
            case 'A': x--; break; // Move left
            case 'D': x++; break; // Move right
        }
    }
}
```

Test this by using a simple command-line input mechanism to simulate player movement:

```shell
> Enter direction (WASD): A
Player moved left
```

#### Exercise 6.2 -- Enemy Interactions

Create an `Enemy` class in `Enemy.java`. Have enemies be stored using an `ArrayList` inside the `Game` class.

```java
public class Enemy {
    private int x, y;
    
    public Enemy(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    public void moveTowardsPlayer(Player player) {
        // Implement logic to move towards the player
    }
}
```

Each enemy should have a method to interact with the player based on proximity (e.g., reduce score, end game).

#### Exercise 6.3 -- Scoring System

Implement a static utility method in `GameUtils.java` to calculate scores based on time or performance.

```java
public class GameUtils {

    public static int calculateScore(int elapsedTime, int enemiesDefeated) {
        return enemiesDefeated * 10 - elapsedTime;
    }
}
```
Demonstrate the utility by integrating it into gameplay.

#### Exercise 6.4 -- Putting it All Together

Write the main method in `Game.java` to simulate a game loop, handling player inputs, moving enemies, and updating scores.

```java
public class Game {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Game game = new Game();
        game.start();
    }

    private void start() {
        // Example interaction loop
    }
}
```
